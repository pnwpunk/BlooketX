btw I found the blooket font: Titan-One

## What is this?

This is a collection of different popular hacks and cheats for Blooket. None of them were made by me at the moment. Scroll down to the bottom of the page for credits and more details. I have only chosen hacks that can be run on a chromebook since most people play blooket at school on their chromebooks.

## How to use?

If the Hack / Cheat is labeled with "Console" then simply do Ctrl+Shift+j to open the console and paste the script. <br>
If the Hack / Cheat is labeled with "Bookmarklet" then simply put `javascript:` in the search bar before the script.

## News

Glixzzy Blooket Hacks no longer works since he has moved them to a different location. Because of this change I have put the new scripts of the cheats here. I have also removed flood games since it no longer works. I am aware that right now this repository is sorta empty. All it contains are hacks / cheats from Glixzzy. I promise you if someone releases a better and good cheat that actually works I will add it to this repository.
